# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST Dataset)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, where each image is a 28x28 grayscale image representing digits from 0 to 9.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits. It is split into
